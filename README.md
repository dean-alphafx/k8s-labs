# K8S Labs

The goal of this repo is to archive notes and comments about Kubernetes parts.

This jupyter notebook on root contains a few analysis functions based on process

*To simplify no informer or callbacks initiators are tracker, it still possible to abstract the
API machinery and map the react functions in each of the events.*
