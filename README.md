# Kubernetes Labs

The goal of this repo is to archive notes and comments about all Kubernetes components, inspired by the
TGIK grokking Kubernetes series. These notes are a compilation of official documentation, source code comments,
lectures and events and any related material with the topic in discussion.

NOTE: This jupyter notebook on root contains a few analysis functions based on process mining techniques 
to help understand and dig deeper into the Kubernetes source code.

*To simplify no informer or callbacks initiators are tracked, it still possible to abstract the
API machinery and map the react functions in each of the events.*
